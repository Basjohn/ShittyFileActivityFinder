# ShittyFileActivityFinder
Allows you to monitor any drive and even specific folders for all I/O activity. Great for finding Savegame locations.

# TRUSTMEBRO
Ironically lost the python files and source yet this is one of the few projects that doesn't give false AV flags.

# USAGE
Ideally pick a drive or folder and it will list all activity, logging this up to 1200 entries.
Most useful for C:\Users or other pinpoint locations so you can tell when an obscure application has plopped itself somewhere (Like a savegame)
Restarting the app is less likely to stall than hot switching locations, but hot-switching does work.
